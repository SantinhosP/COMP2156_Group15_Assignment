Assignment Policy:
• All assignments must be submitted on the due date based on an instruction given by the
professor. Late assignments will be penalized 10% per day to a maximum of 5 days, the
weekend included, unless the student has notified the professor (via e-mail, phone or in
person) ahead of the due date that he/she has a valid reason for a late submission.
• Students are responsible for ensuring their marks are up to date on the blackboard. No
mark will change after two weeks from when marks were posted on Blackboard.
